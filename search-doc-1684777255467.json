Don't add these to your regular expression. ReadLayer takes care of it. Examples​ Query: East Midlands|West Midlands|London Goal: find any of the terms &quot;East Midlands&quot;, &quot;West Midlands&quot;, or &quot;London&quot;. The differences between the East Midlands and the West Midlands I only found out when I moved to Cov.  Query: (\\p{N})+ Goal: find numbers The current population increase is estimated at 67 million people per year Page number 5  Query: \\p{Sc} Goal: find currency symbols In November 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal  Query: (stop)\\w* Goal: find all words starting with &quot;stop&quot; Please stop there You are stopping at the end  Query: ([\\w\\.\\-]+)@([\\w\\-]+)((\\.(\\w){2,3})+) Goal: find email addresses in a page or document Contact me at gerard@online.com. "},{"title":"Similar​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Queries","url":"/queries#similar","content":"Find similar terms or passages. tip If you use double quotes &quot;, ReadLayer will behave in the same way as with the Strict query. You can combine strict and similar terms or sentences. By default, this type of query will use your language settings defined in Settings &gt; Language. However, you can fine tune each of your queries to use a different language. Once you have created a new item, adjust its language in the item settings. note Currently, ReadLayer finds related terms by inflection, not semantically. Examples​ Query: &quot;miR-378&quot; Goal: find exact match miR-378 suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by inhibiting SDAD1  Query: &quot;miR-378&quot; &quot;SDAD1&quot; Goal: find passages where the terms &quot;miR-378&quot; and &quot;SDAD1&quot; are near each other We found that miR-378 expression was low in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-378 not only inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro by inducing apoptosis, but also inhibits migration and invasion by inhibiting the EMT of colon cancer cells. SDAD1 is a direct target gene of miR-378. We also confirmed that miR-378 alleviated the malignant phenotypes of colon cancer cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Conclusion: miR-378 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by targeting SDAD1.  Query: &quot;BORIS&quot; regulation Goal: Find the term &quot;BORIS&quot; near related terms to &quot;regulation&quot;. The evolution of epigenetic regulators CTCF and BORIS/CTCFL in amniotes. This indicates that BORIS might have important regulatory roles in tumor immortalization during tumorigenesis.  Query: fire weld arrest Goal: Find passages that talk about the people arrested for starting a fire by welding The interior minister, Manuel Monsalve, confirmed that 17 people had been arrested for possibly starting fires by such activities as welding or burning wool.
